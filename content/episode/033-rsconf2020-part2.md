### Talking points

#### Intro

* My experience in creating the poster
* What I envision with the shinyverse

#### Interview

#### Insights & takeaways from course

* Excellent structure (JS, CSS, HTML are very intertwined)
* Preparation was evident
* Cool to see me and Maya working on a similar project without even knowing

#### RStudioconf overall impressions

* Styling shiny apps SASS and bootstrap 4 Joe Cheng
    - shinydashboard usage caught them by surprise
    - as someone in life sciences, it is so hard to get out of my head the "other" company that sounds just like SASS
    - funny moment: code was too small and Joe thought he heard voices in his head 14:44-15:23
    - another great tool: real time previewer tool
    - next version of Shiny will have plot autocolor feature

* Tech debt is a social problem (Gordon Shotwell)
    - People can be biased on how they might address tech debt
    - Can over-estimate how good something is
    - forgive the mess
    - emphathy with the debtor is important
    - embracing that encountering tech debt is a good thing: 18:15-18:42

* Logger package is awesome
* Ryan Timpe's talk
* Future package
* shinymeta (finally makes more sense)
* James Blair's plumber talk very well done
* T-mobile R in production (they have a call to action too)

#### Wrapup

* Enjoyed the NSSD 101 interview with JJ Allaire
* Was cool to be interviewed on the Michael Dominick show to share a bit about R to a software developer community
