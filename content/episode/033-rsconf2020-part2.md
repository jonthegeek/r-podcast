### Talking points

#### Intro

* My experience in creating the poster
* What I envision with the shinyverse

#### Interview

#### Insights & takeaways from course

* Excellent structure (JS, CSS, HTML are very intertwined)
* Preparation was evident
* Cool to see me and Maya working on a similar project without even knowing

#### Shiny content at RStudioconf overall impressions

* Styling shiny apps SASS and bootstrap 4 Joe Cheng
    - shinydashboard usage caught them by surprise
    - as someone in life sciences, it is so hard to get out of my head the "other" company that sounds just like SASS
    - funny moment: code was too small and Joe thought he heard voices in his head 14:44-15:23
    - another great tool: real time previewer tool
    - next version of Shiny will have plot autocolor feature

* Shinymeta (Carson Sievert)
    - Not my first time hearing it, but makes more sense now
    - A good example of how iterating over a topic can lead to great things
    
* Logger package (Gergely Daroczi) (pronounced Jerglay)
    - Must have for any type of "production" R workflow
    - Ability to log shiny interactions!

#### Listener feedback

* Ricardo's feedback on RStudio's move to becoming a B-Corp
     - "personally I think it becomes painfully obvious that the role of businesses needs to evolve because the needs we have out of those businesses have evolved as a society"
     - Messaging is important: Ricardo's exposure to B-Corps was not idea in a university course.  I can relate in a much different way, see my Java course in undergrad
     - Check out his tutorials introducing tidyverse concepts with cryptocurrency data.  Cool stuff!
     - Thanks for the great feedback!

* Richard's  question (sent to me on twitter) looking for a good tutorial on using the servr package for real-time previewing of R markdown documents:
     - These days I simply use the `infinite_moon_reader` function from the `xaringan` package because it wraps the servr functionality and can be used for any R-markdown document.  Perhaps that can solve your issue?
     
#### Wrapup

* Enjoyed the NSSD 101 interview with JJ Allaire
* Was cool to be interviewed on the Michael Dominick show (epsiode 8) to share a bit about R to a software developer community
* I want to dedicate next episode to some of the awesome nuggets related to R-Markdown that were shared at rstudio conf, perhaps with a special guest too
