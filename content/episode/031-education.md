### Draft of questions

* Engaging students early on in a data science / stats class has always been challenging, especially for those who are taking the course because it is required or don't think it will be interesting to them.  What techniques have worked for you to get your classes started effectively?
* One issue I encountered during my education (long ago) was how proprietary tools were "locked in" to the course (office products, stat computing languages, etc).  Do you see academic departments embracing open-source tech more than in the past?
* I really enjoyed the Advanced R Markdown course earlier this year and seeing the finished product so to speak with the materials.  Have you been able to leverage insights gained from your experience teaching in the academic setting to how you develop and lead these workshops?
* While you can go a long way in R today without previous experience in programming and other computing tools, I've always thought that having at least a basic understanding on coding best practices and troubleshooting skills can make the experience much smoother.  How do you strike the balance of not overwhelming students with CS/programming topics but still set them up well for exploring data and creating insights on their own?
* I've seen both of you leverage R-Markdown and various extensions in your course or workshop materials.  While it can do a lot already, do you see areas you wish could be improved?
* I recently saw a webinar from Greg Wilson talking about many concepts I never even thought to explore such as learner personas and mental models. How generalizable are these concepts to different teaching paradigms, say from traditional academic courses to speacialized workshops to professionals?
* Best strategies for teaching version control benefits and implementation?
* Advice on teaching R to other professionals coming from another statistical computing language or tool
* Both of you have summer interns this year (as well as others on the RStudio education team) working on interesting projects.  Tell us a bit about these projects and how they fit in the overall vision for the education team.
* We are each parents of young children :)  Do you have visions of trying to get your kids learning data science and if so how would you approach it?
* Tell our listeners about some of the projects you are working on these days and how they can get in touch?
