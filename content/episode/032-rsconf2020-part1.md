1. Public Benefit Corporations news

* Chatter/rumors before the keynote about a big annoucement coming.  No one was saying any hints other than "you will really like it"
* JJ announced that RStudio has officially become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). This is the first time I've heard of this term
* We will link to JJ's blogpost and keynote slides
* Other tech news sites (even podcasts about open-source news) covered this story.  I don't recall another time recently that an event in the R community received this much mainstream tech press
* What does this mean to me?  After a bit of reflection, I feel relief.  
* JJ received a standing ovation at the end, it was one of the more powerful moments I've experienced at this event.
* I did a bit of research and will link to a nice summary article on the details of a PBC.  Here are my takeaways
     + While this doesn't outright prevent another company from acquiring RStudio, it at least offers "takover" protection.  One example is that "merged" corporation's certificate of incorporation needs to contain identical provisions that detail public benefits, otherwise the transaction must receive at least 2/3 of the desired company's voting shares. 
     + RStudio has now the legal freedom to consider how decisions impact stakeholders besides the actual shareholders.  A company's board now has the right (and duty) to consider the public's good and social benefits/risks for key decisions
     + A growing number of investors are becoming more interested to invest in companies that are socially responsible.  Some are called "impact" investors and they tend to believe that the long-term value of a PBC is better than a typical for-profit corporation
     + The potential disadvantages I've seen mentioned are that it may be more difficult for some investors to be certain on trade performance and uncertain legal precedence on how a PBC balances competing interests potentially from shareholders and the constituents.
* I have been following open-source software and the business side of it for a long time, and it's interesting to me that none of the major vendors in a similar position as RStudio have gone for PBC status.
* My hope is that it allows RStudio to invest more resources in the kinds of initiatives that can position the value of their open-source mentatlity to customers that still don't quite get the value open-source brings
* I am also curious if this news will alleviate concerns about RStudio's influence on the broader R community.  If the broader community is going to be a first-class "public constituent" that RStudio is going to "legally" be mandated to serve the community's best interest in addition to their shareholders.
* Time will tell how much we see, but again I am relieved that this was not an "acquisition" announcement.

2. RWeekly curators unite

* Some already know, but I take great pride in being one of the rotating curators for RWeekly.  It was so exciting to have 4 of us present at the same conferenc!  Colin Faye (author of Golem and great guy) I met at last year's RStudio Conference.  I was able to have dinner with him and Christophe Devuex from ThinkR multiple times, and never once did they get sick of me :) 
* It was great to meet Jonathan Carroll for the first time!  We've knowen eachoter virtually for years, in fact he was one of the very first listeners to this little podcast.  We had lots of fun talking about the trends we're seeing in the R community and the R core team, and share storeis of our Shiny developements (he and I work in the same industry!)
* I met Ryo <insert last name for the first time as well (he came all the way from Japan).  He's published some really cool and insightful analyess of "football"  data (the world football that is) and I learned that he is also a hockey fan like me!
* If you are listening to this on your smartphone you'll see the cool photo Colin took of the 4 of us.  
*There's been a little bit of a turnover in our curator group, and we would welcome anyone who is passoionate about RWeekly's mission to join our team!  Visit Rweekly.org (TODO find real link in the site).  We've been discussing ways of using new advancements in the automations possible to alleviate some of the manual efforts, but we could certainly use help in seeing that through

3. Interview with Kevin Ushey

4. Residual Snippets!

* Meant to be completely informal, off-the-cuff, kind of like a blog but in audio form
* A chance for me to play with some cool backend technology (mainly AWS) and with a bit of python
* Once I got the Telegram API and AWS stuff figured out, I wanted to be a little different with how I serve the files.  So along comes shinyMobile by David Granjon, and a cool package called waveSurfer by Athos Petri Damia
* Also big shoutout to Maelle Salmon (fellow RWeekly curator and all around awesome person) who wrote an excellent post on using the utterances widget to capture comments via GitHub issues
* Somehow, Residual Snippets is actually on the Apple Podcasts service (who knew!) so if you want to listen via an actual podcast client, I won't judge!
