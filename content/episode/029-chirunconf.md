### segment intro

* Conference took place on March 9-10 in chicago
* GitHub issues for potential projects, got lots of activity the week before the conference
* Slack space was great, had each person introduce themselves in the welcome channel
* Great to have my colleague Will Landau attend too, he went to the university of chicago for his undergrad
* Mixer dinner night before, great to meet a few of the attendees already
* Really nice campus, pleasant walks from the hotel, Will shared great stories about the campus and his time there
* warm-up exercise, patterend after some of the ropensci unfoncerences
* question about if we knew where we fit in the R community, I stayed in the middle because I want to be more involved in helping use R and help improve various packages and create interesting apps to showcase its usage, I have not done enough of that in my opinion, so this unconf was a great chance to see what I could accomplish in two days
* Huge thanks to Joshua Golberg (data scientist at Nuveen investments) for the awesome photos throughout the event TODO add link to his Google photos album


### footrulr

* https://github.com/kanishkamisra/footrulr Compare sentences using Machine Translation and Text Summarization evaluation metrics
* Measure quality of generated text using human references as examples
* Say translating from one language to another, know both language, and for a given french line they get the english line
* Cpmpare the machine-translated version with the human versions
* The goal of footrulr is to provide some functionality to compute sentence comparisons using metrics frequently employed in Machine Translation and Text Summarization evaluation.
* Compare generated text of english with given references of the humans
* Mauro was very helpful to share his perspectives on package development and organization

### Drake updates

* Ben Listyg @BListyg made a ton of progress on wlandau/drake-examples#13. He added a new example drake-powered workflow for a real social science research problem. The runtime is long enough to motivate the usefulness of drake.
* https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/tree/master/fcd
* TJ Mahr @tjmahr fixed some substantial issues in drake itself (ropensci/drake#743 and ropensci/drake#741) and joined the official list of drake contributors. He also began adapting one of his current behavioral research projects to use drake.
* @kangel09 fixed ropensci/drake#750 and ropenscilabs/drake-manual#64, adding links to guidance on how to use drake and tensorflow together.
* We submitted drake 7.0.0 to CRAN: ropensci/drake#753.
