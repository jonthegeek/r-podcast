The name is inspired from Rstudioâ€™s yardstick package for Machine Learning evaluation metrics.

### Drake updates

* Ben Listyg @BListyg made a ton of progress on wlandau/drake-examples#13. He added a new example drake-powered workflow for a real social science research problem. The runtime is long enough to motivate the usefulness of drake.
* https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/tree/master/fcd
* TJ Mahr @tjmahr fixed some substantial issues in drake itself (ropensci/drake#743 and ropensci/drake#741) and joined the official list of drake contributors. He also began adapting one of his current behavioral research projects to use drake.
* @kangel09 fixed ropensci/drake#750 and ropenscilabs/drake-manual#64, adding links to guidance on how to use drake and tensorflow together.
* We submitted drake 7.0.0 to CRAN: ropensci/drake#753.
